Linux basic commands::
    
1. whoami
2.sudo -i -> Switch to most privilege user
3.pwd -> print working directory
4.ls
5. ls -a-> hidden files which starts with .
6.ls -l -> long list like permissions and timestamp
7.cd /usr
8.cd .. -> moving one directory above
9. cd../.. --> 2 levels directory back
10.cd ~ -> previous location
11.mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3
12.mkdir -p india/telangana/hyderbad -> nested dirctory -p is parent
13.ls -R india -> This gives all the sub directory list (recursive list)

imp -> 1.Absolute path - Always begin with / (root) --> mkdir /opt/edureka
2. relative path - does't starts with root.--> mkdir edureka

creating files 
1. cat 
2. touch
3. vi/vim editor 

cat::->concantination( using cat command we can't change the existing data)

cat >file1.txt
i am daisy mom
cntrl + d -> denies next line and goes back 

cat file1.txt -> view the data
cat file1.txt -n -> giveswith numbers
cat file1.txt file2.txt >file3.txtn -> joining two file or more in the same way(overwrite)
cat file1.txt >> file2.txt( Appending the file1 data to file2)

touch :: files with no data added
To add data we use echo command

14. cp  /root/employee.txt /opt -> copy
15. copy command does it in backend  if you want to see in front end use -v
cp -v /root/employee.txt /opt -> verbose mode
 cp -r dir1  /opt -> To copy a directory we need -r -> recursive mode
 mv file1.txt newfile.txt -> This is for cut and paste
 rm file2.txt --> remove files
 rmdir dir.txt --> to remove directories but not nested
 rmdir -r  india --> The nested directory can be removed
 date
 cal
 cal -3
 Tail and head  to see some particular no of  lines
 tail -20 kernel.log--> get last 20 lines from the log
 df -hT -> 
 du -sh -> directory usage 
  graphical Editors 
  
  gedit
  nedit
  pico
  
  Text based esditors in linux
  vi
  vim
  nano
  
  Shell Scripting:: Series of commands executing together

Ex :: For automation we can write a small script to take a back up everyday at 6pm
 Let create an example script 
 vi script.sh
 !#/bin/bash
 mkdir project
 cd project
 cp /var/log/*.log .
 
 save and come out of vi editor 
 
 To run sh script.sh
 To find whether scipt executed or not $?
 If it returns zero then script got executed succesfully
 
 grep 
 
In linux if you want to see all the user related info 
cat /etc/password
grep -i edureka /etc/passwd
sed -> stremmed editor
 which means you can add in conditions to streamline the result in linux 
 
 ex:: sed -n '5p' /boot/grub/grub.cfg
 This gives only the 5th line printed
  To substitute the word in the file 
  
  cat file.txt
  word1.txt
  word2.txt
  word3.txt
  
  To cange the word to world we can use sed
  sed -e 's/word/world' file.txt  ----> s in the command is meant for substitution
  gives us output as 
  world1.txt
  world2.txt
  world3.txt
  
  To delete all the empty lines from the file 
  
  sed -e  '/^$/d' file  -> d here stands for delete ^$ -> this is for empty lines

awk command

awk -F: '{print $1,$NF}'  /etc/passwrd  --> This prints the first and last feild

alias command --> alias cls=clear
so we can use cls to clear the screeen from now on

Package managment in ubuntu 
we use apt-get  -> This advanced command used to manage packages in ubuntu

In centos we have a package manger called as YUM

Important(improved version of telnet)  SSH->secure schell (using ssh we access remote desktops)
If you don't want your remote machine to connect to others by ssh -> we can stop sshg --> systemctl stop sshd
so even if you run ssh <ip>  it says the port has been blocked and can't be connected
To start the sshd -->systemctl start sshd

So everytime to login in to remote machine we need to provide password so get passwordless authentication we generate keys
ssh-keygen
We share only the public key but not the private key for others to connect to remote desktop
So to copy the key :: ssh-copy-id root@<username of the machine you wants to copy key to>
post the copy is completed you can ssh without any password

netcat -> General cli tool to read/write/redirecting data accross the network
network debugging
netcat -l 8080 --> server will now listen on port 8080 for inbound connections
